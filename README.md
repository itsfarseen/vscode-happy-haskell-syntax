# Alex Syntax Highlighting for VS Code

I don't have time to create yet another account (Azure Dev Account) on yet another
service and go through all the headache to publish this extension.

Here's how to install it:

```bash
npm install -g vsce

cd myExtension
vsce package
# myExtension.vsix generated
# Install this file in VS Code, type Ctrl+Shift+P and search for VSIX
```
